# Bike-Rentals-Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for Linear Regression model, built to predict the demand for shared bikes.

## Problem Statement

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, model the demand for shared bikes and interpret the factors affecting the demand.

The dataset used for the project is attached in the same repo.

## Conclusions

Factors like Season, Weather especially during Rain/Snow, Temperature, Humidity levels or even the fact that it is a working day or holiday affect the demand for Bike rentals. Also, majorly the year, when pandemic breaks out or some other uncontrollable factor kicks in, demand is tremendously affected.

A prediction model as such can be used to predict the rentals for given day and on given other factors. This info can be used to accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
